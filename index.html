<h1 class="bg-info">About Me</h1>
    <p><em>My name Ryan Leslie I grew up in Tacoma,WA I am 30 years and have lived in Portland  for the last three years almost. I have been attending Portland Community College for the last 2 years and am 2 classes away from a Business Transfer Degree. I decided to come to Epicodus because I wanted a more direct root to a career and  the want to stay ahead of the job market which is all moving towards tech. Computers have never been my strong suit and has always been something I wanted to improve on. I have most worked in car sales and construction through the duration of my twenties. I have lived in La,seattle,Portland and New Jersey and have been to a few different countries in the past ten years. I don't have very many hobbies these days besides working out and saving up to travel.</em> </p>
